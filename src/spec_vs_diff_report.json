  "summary": "REQ-19/REQ-20 appear to be implemented via (1) wrapping tab content in an error boundary to prevent blank/empty screens on runtime errors, (2) defensive cleanup for modal side effects that can lock the UI, and (3) hardening reminder/notification/localStorage code paths with guards + try/catch so browser API failures don’t crash rendering. The diff summary also indicates several additional changes outside the requested scope (e.g., PDF upload, main entry point, new/updated error boundary UI), which were not explicitly requested.",
